# 📚 Homework Submission Hashes on Aptos

## 📝 Description
This project is a simple **Aptos Move smart contract** that enables students to submit homework in the form of **file hashes**.  
The actual file is stored **off-chain** (Google Drive, IPFS, or local storage), while only the **hash (SHA-256)** is committed on-chain.  
This ensures proof of **originality**, **authenticity**, and **time of submission** without heavy on-chain storage costs.

---

## 🌟 Vision
The vision of this project is to **digitize and decentralize academic submissions**, providing:
- ✅ Transparent record-keeping for students and teachers.  
- ✅ Immutable timestamps for submission deadlines.  
- ✅ Easy verification of originality by recomputing file hashes.  
- ✅ A foundation for future decentralized academic systems (certificates, evaluations, plagiarism checks).  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Support for **assignment creation by instructors** with deadlines.  
- Ability to handle **multiple versions** of student submissions.  
- **Event emission** for off-chain indexing and UI dashboards.  
- Integration with **frontend apps** (React/Streamlit) for uploading files, computing hashes, and submitting directly.  
- Expansion into a **complete academic proof system** with grading and certifications.
